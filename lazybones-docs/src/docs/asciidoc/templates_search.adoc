== Search Templates

To see what templates you can install, run

[source,shell]
----
lazybones list
----

This will list all aliases and remote templates. If you want to see
what templates you have cached locally, run

[source,shell]
----
lazybones list --cached
----

In fact, `--cached` is implied if Lazybones can't connect to the internet.

You can also find out more about a template through the info command:

[source,shell]
----
lazybones info <template name>
----

This will print a description of the template and what versions are
available for it. If you're offline, this will simply display an error
message.
