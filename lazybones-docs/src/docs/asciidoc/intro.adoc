== Intro

Lazybones was born out of frustration that Ratpack does not and will
not have a command line tool that will bootstrap a project. It's a
good decision for Ratpack, but I'm lazy and want tools to do the
boring stuff for me.

The tool is very simple: it allows you to create a new project
structure for any framework or library for which the tool has a
template. You can even contribute templates by sending pull requests
to this GitHub project or publishing the packages to the relevant
Bintray repository (more info available below).

The concept of Lazybones is very similar to Maven archetypes, and what
Yeoman does for web applications. Lazybones also includes a
subtemplates feature that resembles the behaviour of Yeoman's
sub-generators, allowing you to generate optional extras (controllers,
scaffolding etc.) inside a project.
