Lazybones Project Creation Tool
===============================

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pledbrook/lazybones/master/media/lazybones-logo-hires.png" width="200px">

Lazybones was born out of frustration that [Ratpack](https://ratpack.io)
does not and will not have a command line tool that will bootstrap a project.
It's a good decision for Ratpack, but I'm lazy and want tools to do the boring
stuff for me.

The tool is very simple: it allows you to create a new project structure for
any framework or library for which the tool has a template. You can even
contribute templates by sending pull requests to this GitHub project or publishing
the packages to the relevant [Bintray repository](https://bintray.com/repo/browse/pledbrook/lazybones-templates)
(more info available below).

The concept of Lazybones is very similar to Maven archetypes, and what [Yeoman](http://yeoman.io/)
does for web applications. Lazybones also includes a subtemplates feature that
resembles the behaviour of Yeoman's sub-generators, allowing you to generate optional
extras (controllers, scaffolding etc.) inside a project.
